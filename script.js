//* Have the Computer Guess your Number ---------------------------------------------
/* 
    Build out the functionality for the computer to guess and evaluate your random number.

    - There are two static functions framed. DO NOT alter the name or parameters of these functions:
        - startCompGuess(num)
        - compGuess(reply)

    *hint:
        - don't forget that variables are a way for us to store information and update later.
        - What is the "current number"? The lowest number? Highest?

    You are not limited to just these functions. Feel free to create a new function that may be called to help manage the flow of your code.
